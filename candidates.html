                Hello gamers! My name is Jessie and I am running for co-president with my co-gamer Patrick! Throughout my time at ICSSC, I have made some of my best memories at UCI and met some of the best people! I have joined several organizations at UCI but ICSSC was the one where I truly felt the most comfortable in and felt that I could be my myself! I first joined ICSSC my second year as an events committee member. As an events committee member I helped plan events for the ICS community. Some events ICSSC hosted that year were ICSSC Goes Hiking and Let's Get this Gingerbread! This year, I am the secretary where I compose the weekly newsletters and help out with other administrative tasks as needed! I also help plan coordinate events with the events lead! Some events I helped plan were our ICSSC Valentine's Game & Movie Night and our ICSSC Late Night Ramen Competition! Events that really unite and bond the ICS community together and spark joy are, in my opinion, the best and most fun ones! I also act as one of our Bytes through our mentorship program, Bits & Bytes, that really fueled my passion for this club even more!
                <br>
                <br>
                I am running for President because this club is something I am truly passionate and dedicated to and I want to extend those feelings I had when I first joined to anyone who may be looking for a place at UCI! I want to use this chance to build a stronger community among the ICS school and be able to collaborate with other departments to extend our students horizons. No club is perfect and I am more than happy to listen to anyone who may have suggestions, recommendations, advice, etc. to help ICSSC become the best it can be! I also want to show how ICSSC is the number one choice to become a well-rounded gamer as we host social, professional, and academic events, and we hope to plan more of these events in the next years! I hope that we will accomplish much more together in the next year!

              <p class="mb-4">
                Hello everyone! My name is Patrick Nguyen, and I am a third-year Computer Science Major. I am currently this year's Events Chair, and I am running to be next year's ICS Student Council Co-President with my friend Jessie Chang.
                <br>
                <br>
                I first joined ICS Student Council my sophomore year, where I joined as an Events Committee member, where I collaborated with the Events Chair into planning and coordinating social events to enhance the student experience. Currently, I serve as ICSSC Events Chair, where my role is to coordinate and lead the Events Committee into hosting events that help the ICS student body socially, academically, or professionally.
                <br>
                <br>
                As Events Chair, I had three goals in mind for events - create a welcoming community for ICS students during this period of virtual instruction, host workshops to help ICS students with real-world skills, and bring back the Jams.
                <br>
                <br>
                Throughout the year, the Events Committee and I hosted a variety of different social events for ICS students to come and meet each other during quarantine with the most noteworthy event being the Club Penguin ICS Bonfire. At the bonfire, new and returning students joined us at our virtual bonfire to play a bunch of games and make new friends.
                <br>
                <br>
                My other goal as Events Chair was to host workshops to assist ICS students with skills not mentioned in classes. To accomplish this goal, my committee and I started a series of workshops hosted called the Missing Quarter, which is modeled after MIT’s Missing Semester. Some of the topics were covered were Bash Scripting to help ICS students master the command-line, and Profiling and Debugging Tools to help find nasty bugs quicker and more efficiently.
                <br>
                <br>
                My last goal was to bring back a previous tradition of ICS Student Council - Jams. Previously, ICS Student Council held annual Jams throughout the year, where ICS students could work together to develop new applications for a variety of prizes. Due to unfortunate circumstances, ICS Student stopped hosting annual Jams, and I made it my goal to bring back the Jams this year. After a six-year hiatus, I led the planning and coordination of WebJam, a week-long competition where teams of students work together to develop web applications. In addition to WebJam, we decided to change things up by creating the first-ever Jam for Change, a week-long development competition where teams work together to develop applications for social good.
                <br>
                <br>
                If I am elected as co-president, I hope to continue ICS Student Council’s mission of working to improve the lives of the ICS student body academically, socially, and professionally. If Fall Quarter will be in-person, one of my biggest goals is to safely welcome ICS students back to UCI.  Most if not all incoming freshmen and sophomores will have in-person instruction at UCI for the first time. To build a community for ICS students, I intend to establish ICSSC’s Jams and Bits and Bytes as an annual tradition. These programs have been successful this year, so I hope to establish these programs as traditions, so future years of ICS students can benefit from them.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am proud of all the progress that ICSSC has made this year, and I hope to continue working with ICSSC next year to help continue ICSSC’s mission of improving the lives of ICS students socially, academically, and professionally. ICSSC has been such a great community of friends for me, and I hope to continue making an impact in this organization next year. Thank you for reading my statement, and I hope you will consider me for ICSSC Co-President.

              <p class="mb-4">
                Hello everyone! I’m Ryan, a second-year computer science major, and I’m running to be ICSSC’s next Internal Vice President. As I’ve become increasingly involved within Student Council over the past one and half years, I’ve fully immersed myself within the ICSSC community, and believe I am prepared to instill this same passion and sense of belonging in the next generation of ICSSC members!
                <br>
                <br>
                I joined the ICSSC Events Committee at the beginning of my freshman year, and the Projects Committee six months later. Both of these experiences have been incredible on their own: I learned everything from event planning to how to work effectively with a team, and grew my confidence and leadership skills. But by combining them, being the only ICSSC member on multiple committees has given me a unique perspective on how inter-committee relations work. For instance, some of ICSSC’s marquee events such as WebJam and Jam for Change were collaborations between the Events and Projects Committee, and being a member of both committees I was able to contribute to these events from multiple angles and witness how information passed between committees. Understanding how ICSSC operates from different perspectives will be extremely valuable as Internal Vice President, where I will need to bring all of the different areas of ICSSC together.
                <br>
                <br>
                Being part of multiple committees also gave me the opportunity to meet and befriend many amazing people who I may not have met otherwise, which is why I plan to place a greater emphasis on inter-committee relations as ICSSC Internal VP! If elected, I will encourage each committee to have at least one collaboration with every other committee — which could be an event, workshop, project, or anything else. This would allow members to gain planning experience, new friendships, and a greater sense of community within ICSSC. On a smaller scale, I could help facilitate small “families” within the council consisting of people from different committees, which would help members meet each other without the pressure of hosting an event.
                <br>
                <br>
                Next year ICSSC will be in the unique position of welcoming *both* the Class of 2024 and Class of 2025 to UCI for the first time, which means it will be especially important to build a sense of belonging within Council from the start. I am up for the challenge, and will ensure I put my best effort into making ICSSC a memorable experience for everyone!

                I am running for External Vice President because I want to support the ICS community and cooperate with other clubs more. Clubs are an essential part of college experience and for me ICSSC was one of the clubs I felt really shaped my college life. Additionally, I feel strong cooperation between ICSSC and other clubs will help us interact with more peers and have a farther reach of impact. I feel I am proficient at communication, being the Corporate Outreach chair at ICSSC and communicating with companies. Moreover, my job in UCI Middle Earth requires me to communicate with multiple RAs, clubs, and on-campus organizations to help plan events for residents. Thank you.
