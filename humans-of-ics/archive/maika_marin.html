          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            Year: 3rd </br>
            Major: Informatics </br>
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            Iqra: Hi everyone! This quarter's first feature for Humans of ICS is Maika! Maika, can you start off by introducing yourself?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            Maika: Yes, thank you for having me! My name is Maika. I'm a 3rd year Informatics Major, emphasizing in Human Computer Interaction and I plan on minoring in Management as well.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: So, why did you choose Informatics as your major?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            M: It's actually a funny story! I came to UCI undeclared and I thought I wanted to go Bus Admin and I was taking classes and then I was able to get into ICS 31. It was a bit shocking and I was really nervous to take the class because I heard a lot of things about it. In the end, I was very happy to take it because it opened up a lot of opportunities for me to explore different majors, from BIM to Informatics. I chose to do Informatics because I was a lot more interested in the Informatics upperdivs and I was interested in going into UI/UX design after college.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: That's great! How do you plan on using your Informatics major and Management minor? What field do you want to go into?
        </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            M: Yeah, so going into college, I knew I was interested in the cross section of business and technology and how the two interact. Before going into college, I didn't know the opportunities that were out there for me to be able to do that, but I think being able to talk to people with different majors gave me more insight. With that, I found I was interested in UI/UX design as well as tech consulting. I think that's really cool because I am able to go into experiences into different tech companies, while also being able to work in a business environment.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Awesome! Can you tell me about something you are passionate about and where you developed that passion?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            M: This has nothing to do with my major, but I think something that I recently became passionate about is sustainability and the environment. I think looking back at it now and after watching documentaries during quarantine about our earth and our climate and hearing about events happening now, like the fires in Irvine, gave me a realization about having the responsibility to do our part and take care of the planet. Even if it's the smallest things like using less water or stop using plastic bags. Something as small as those can still make a really big impact, so I think trying to implement smaller changes into my daily life that will add up. I try not to waste as much plastic when buying produce at a grocery store and try to be more mindful about the products that I use. I really found myself getting more into this since quarantine.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: I completely agree! Every action, no matter how small, counts and we have to start somewhere!
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            M: Exactly!
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: What's one piece of advice you would give yourself before coming to UCI?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            M: That's a good one! I feel like there's a lot of things that I learned since I came to UCI. This is probably super basic and cliche, but I would tell myself to say yes to everything. I think going into college, you should be very open to opportunities. Even if you think you might not be interested in, you should still try it out because you never know if you end up liking it or it might become your new passion. Definitely say yes to everything and all opportunities because you don't know how that can gateway into other opportunities.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Definitely! Moving onto the more personalized questions, I saw that you participated in HackUCI last year! Can you tell me about your 1st hackathon experience?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            M: It's always something I like to talk about because I think my experience was super interesting. So, HackUCI last year was on the day of my birthday, so that was a very interesting and memorable birthday that I don't think I'll forget! At that time too, I only had taken only 1 or 2 programming languages, so being in that environment and developing something from scratch was something new to me. The whole experience was definitely a big learning curve, just in terms of working with people in a technical community and learning more about Java. I had no experience with Java and I only knew Python. I was making an Android app, so learning that was a great learning experience and memory for me. There was a lot of fun involved in it too just because of all the different opportunities and workshops they provided inside the event itself. It was really cool to participate and see a bunch of people all together in a room that are like-minded.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: That's awesome! Last year was my first hackathon as well, and I feel like in classes, you never get the full experience of building something completely from scratch end-to-end. Participating in a hackathon is a great experience because you get to learn from your peers so much in such a little amount of time.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            M: I definitely agree! There's nothing more than being up at 3 AM coding with 3 coffees down!
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: I also noticed on your interest form that you took an iOS development course from CodePath. I think this is really great since UCI really doesn't offer courses on mobile app dev. Can you tell me more about it and if you liked it?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            M: I 100% recommend CodePath to anyone, even if they are not CS majors. You can still take it too. I think it's a really great resource that UCI provides for anyone of any skill level. I found out about it through a friend who took it before and I think it's really cool because the people who created Codepath were people who worked at big companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon. You get that really cool connection! The way they scheduled and layed out CodePath is that it's like another class you take for 10 weeks. You have projects and people who show you demos and help you. The cool thing is that these aides are also students who previously took the course. After you take the class, you can find further opportunities from CodePath if you want to get more involved, like being a teacher/student helper. They also provide a really great community because they have CodePath in other campuses as well. They help you meet other people and I learned a lot, especially because I had no idea how iOS development works. They provide iOS and Android development courses, so I highly recommend taking one of those. Plus, it's free, so it's really good because you get a certification at the end of 10-weeks. You also do a final project with a group and demo it to industry professionals.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: This sounds like a great opportunity for other students! I also saw that you got a cyber security internship at a Big 4 company. Congratulations! Can you give some advice/tips to others who are interested in cyber security or interning at Big 4 companies?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            M: Yeah! I actually was not planning at all to go into a Big 4 company. I saw a posting on Handshake. For those who don't use Handshake, it's a great resource for UCI students because companies directly post openings to look for UCI students, so it really helps to get you out there! I think the big thing is that I didn't know much about cyber security either, so it was all new to me. But, I was definitely interested and open to going into that pathway. When I was going through the whole interview process, they saw that passion in me about wanting to learn more even if I didn't know a lot about it. I think that's really important when interviewing/talking to people, you really need to show your passion. Also, utilize your technical skills! Being Informatics or CS or Data Science really gives you a step up with having a certain skill that other majors might not have. Communicating these skills and showing it is a really good thing to have during your interview process. Those are some of the tips that I used when I interviewed and applied.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: I completely agree with everything you are saying. A lot of people will have the same technical skills, such as programming in Python or Java or whatever, but being able to showcase your passion for tech and showing how you are passionate about CS outside of school definitely gives you an edge over other applicants.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            M: Exactly!
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: What new skills or hobbies have you acquired since we are now in a remote learning environment?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            M: I've been doing a lot of interesting things! I learned how to skateboard over quarantine. I've never skateboarded before, so I decided to learn. I bought one and now I just love skating around! That was actually really fun because I was at first scared. I also have been going surfing a lot because I actually am from Irvine, so I live pretty close to the beach. It's really nice to get out in the morning before everyone is awake and be out there alone. It's kind of peaceful and there's something about being able to watch the sunrise is something that I really enjoy.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: I also bought a longboard during quarantine but I am still struggling to learn! It’s so hard!
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            M: It is! I was so scared to step on the board at first because I thought I was going to fall off, but I just had to keep trying and trying. I even bought a helmet just in case! Just keep practicing!
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Haha, yes I definitely need to! For our last segment, I will be asking you a series of rapid fire questions!
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            M: Alright!
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: First, are you an early riser or night owl?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            M: Early riser, 100%!
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Spicy or sweet?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            M: Ooh, I would say sweet because I can’t handle spice!
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Puppies or kittens?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            M: Puppies. I follow like 10 puppy Instagram accounts.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Netflix or YouTube?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            M: Netflix
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Talking or texting?
         </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            M: I think talking is better. Sometimes, I get lazy to text and having a FaceTime call or being able to hear someone’s voice is so much better!
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Yes! Facebook or Twitter? </br>
            M: Twitter. I love the memes.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: TikTok or Twitter? </br>
            M: Twitter. I don’t have a TikTok, is that weird?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Really?! You need to get on it!</br>
            M: Yeah, I’m too scared to get addicted to it!
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Haha, that is a valid concern! iOS or Android? </br>
            M: iOS because I have Apple everything.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Cake or ice cream? </br>
            M: Ice cream.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Coffee or tea?</br>
            M: Coffee. I drink coffee like everyday or else I can’t function!
          </p>
          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Coffee or tea?</br>
            M: Coffee. I drink coffee like everyday or else I can’t function!
          </p>
          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: I feel the same way about tea. If I don’t drink it, my head is like exploding and I can’t concentrate.</br>
            M: Yes, that’s how I feel!
          </p>
          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: I: And that concludes our interview! Thank you so much, Maika, for letting me interview you!</br>
