          </p>

            We hope you enjoy reading about Kaitlyn and her passion for sustainable fashion, experience at ZotHacks, and hobbies such as sewing and crocheting!
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            Year: 2nd </br>
            Major: Software Engineering </br>
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            Iqra: Hi everyone! Our next guest for Humans of ICS is Kaitlyn! Kaitlyn, can you start off by introducing yourself?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            Kaitlyn: Hi, my name is Kaitlyn Suzuki and I'm a second year Software Engineering major!
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Why did you choose Software Engineering as your major?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            K: If I'm being honest, during the college application process, I was very overwhelmed by the different major choices. There were so many different options and I’m not sure exactly why I was kind of drawn more to SWE. I was specifically more interested in SWE as opposed to CS, even though I didn't necessarily know the difference between the majors at the time. Now that I'm in it and I know the difference, I think I'm going to stick to the SWE path because I like what I see in terms of future classes.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: So, how did you get into computer science in general?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            K: This story goes back to middle school because I remember I had this one teacher who would always promote coding and technology and he encouraged us to learn how to program. And I kind of just ran with that. I took online courses for HTML and CSS and I would try to build basic websites. But it wasn't until I took AP Computer Science in high school that I really got into programming. It was a lot better than I expected. I actually enjoyed learning Java, and from then on, I knew I was going to stick to it in college.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Yeah, that's great. So what are you passionate about and where did you develop that passion?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            K: I would say that I’m interested in sustainable fashion. I think that's something really important and that's something that we should be paying more attention to because fashion waste is so high, and I think everyone should be trying to be more conscious of how they could help lower their own waste. Some of these include upcycling and making your fashion/clothes last longer. I think we can all try to do a bit more of that and it is hard because fast fashion is a staple in our society. Trends are constantly changing and people feel the need to buy more things from stores like Forever 21. I totally get that, but I think a good alternative is thrifting or upcycling clothing, which is something that I've gotten into.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Yeah, I completely agree. So what are your favorite stores to shop from?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            K: I actually haven't been shopping too much. I've been buying more thrifted clothing (secondhand) as much as I can. Recently I've gone to Goodwill a few times and the store is a bit questionable in terms of some of their ethical policies. But I've been getting into sewing recently. So I've been trying to buy clothing material and then turn it into something that I would personally like.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: That’s so cool! I also saw on your interest form that you are into crocheting. Where did you learn that and what’s the coolest thing you have made so far?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            K: I learned both [sewing and crocheting] by watching tutorials on YouTube. I made this huge blanket recently. It was so big and it took so long, but I was super proud when I got it done. And I sent it to my grandma actually.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: That's so sweet! So, what's one piece of advice you would give yourself before coming to UCI?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            K: I would definitely tell myself to do as much as possible and to try as many things as you can. That's definitely something I kind of regret because now everything is virtual, but I would have definitely told myself to pursue my interests more, whether that be a club or attending some event. I just wish I met more people.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Yeah, definitely. I agree. I feel like when you go to college, not knowing a lot of people and walking into a club without any friends is so intimidating. But, that being afraid is only going to make you miss out on cool opportunities like meeting new people and networking with company reps and all.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            K: Yes, I totally agree!
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: I also saw on your interest form that you are passionate about web development. You talked about a little already, but can you tell me more about how you have been pursuing that lately?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            K: I am still at that beginner stage, so I'm not too deep into web development. I actually participated in my first hackathon, ZotHacks, about a week ago and got more web dev experience at it.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            K: I have been following courses online, such as going through the FreeCodeCamp front-end development course. It's so different from my actual course loads. I'm currently trying to get into more CSS stuff. And I don't have the most experience, but I hope in the future I will get there.
            I tried to learn some React recently for ZotHacks. So, that is also something that I'm going to try to pursue going forward.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Yeah, that's great. I know a lot of first and second years are intimidated to go to hackathons because you feel like you barely know how to program. But going to hackathon is the best way for you to learn new skills and apply your knowledge to actually create a product! Since you attended ZotHacks, a hackathon specifically for 1st and 2nd years, can you tell me more about your experience and what you developed?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            K: I actually applied for ZotHacks last year too, but I didn’t get accepted into it until this year. But it was a very interesting experience because it was my first time and I didn't really know what to expect. It was really good. I had a really good team of people and I think we all worked really well together. It was so interesting and working with our mentor while gaining so much experience helped me learn a lot. But I think the best thing I gained out of it was my interest. I really enjoyed collaborating with others and I am excited to move forward with my passion. My team and I made a web application based on the Bill Clinton meme holding records. Instead, we display a picture of Peter the Anteater and we display records based on your Spotify preferences.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Omg, I love that idea! Aside from that, are you part of any organizations on campus? If so, how did you get involved?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            K: I'm involved in WICS and I just more recently started trying to get involved in the ICSSC. I’ve been a member of WICS since last year, so that’s the main club I’m involved in. I joined WICS because I am really drawn to inclusion and the representation it had and emphasizes. Aside from that, they also have really cool events that I like to attend. For example, company reps come and other times they hold interesting workshops. They held a really good workshop about imposter syndrome and negotiation last year that really spoke to me.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: I definitely think those workshops are super helpful for students because we all share similar struggles. And what hobbies have you gotten into lately since quarantine?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            K: I have been trying to crochet and sew more lately. Aside from that, I also like playing music and instruments and so I've had more time to do that now because we're at home. So sometimes I'll play like the piano or the flute if I'm in the mood to relax after school. I learned both as a kid actually but I lost my touch a bit. I think being at home has definitely sparked my interest again. So I’m trying to regain that skill, because now I can because we have a lot more time.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Awesome! For our last segment of our interview, I have a list of rapid fire questions for you! So early riser or night owl?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            K: Night owl.
