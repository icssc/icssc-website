              <p class="mb-4">
                Hi everyone! My name is Natalie Aguinaldo, I am a third-year computer science major and I serve as this year’s Internal Vice President. I am running to be next year’s ICS Student Council President.
                <br>
                <br>
                As a freshman, I was a member of the ICSSC Corporate Outreach committee, where I worked as a team member to establish ICSSC’s relations with companies for sponsorship. Sophomore year, I joined the public relations committee where I helped promote ICSSC via social media.  Later, I took on the role as Corporate Outreach Chair, where I reached out to companies to support events such as Med App Jam 2019 and ICS Day 2019. As Corporate Outreach chair, I helped secure sponsorship from companies such as Raising Canes, Northrop Grumman, and Garmin for ICS Day. In addition to these roles, I was active in ICS Day planning, where I worked with the ICS Consortium, the collection of all of the ICS affiliated clubs, and learned how to plan a large-scale event like ICS Day.
                <br>
                <br>
                Currently I serve as ICSSC Internal Vice President, where my role is to maintain communications and promote member retention within ICSSC. To promote inter-council transparency, I introduced weekly internal newsletters and quarterly internal council feedback forms. Additionally, I gained event planning experience with events like our 5 week long competition style event called Nerd Fighter. Our goal was to provide diverse and unique events to give prospective members an idea of what ICSSC is all about. I took part in organizing Capture the Flag in Aldrich Park and Robloxian UCI, which was an event where participants were challenged to recreate UCI landmarks using the Roblox Studio game engine. I also organized ICSSC’s Ring Road fundraising efforts, such as our Mochi Donut and Spring Roll Fundraisers, and our Spring Quarter Lake Arrowhead Internal Retreat, (which was sadly cancelled due to the COVID-19 outbreak).
                <br>
                <br>
                As President, I plan to further ICSSC’s mission to better the lives of students within the school of ICS academically, socially, and professionally. While still promoting the culture that ICSSC has created this year, I hope to continue providing a balance of academic, social, and professional events to benefit all of the ICS community, as well as be open to feedback to find more ways that ICSSC can benefit everyone.
                <br>
                <br>
                To continue promoting community within the ICS School I hope to organize an ICSSC Intramural Team. We didn’t get the chance to organize an IM team in the beginning of the year because of low interest, but I believe with the community we have built now, it may be possible. To continue supporting students academically and professionally, I hope to provide more opportunities for academic and professional growth such as continuing ICSSC’s traditional events similar to Med App Jam and Reverse Career Fair, as well as introducing new events, like more advice-style panels, similar to our Big N Internship Panel, but expanded for other topics such as undergrad research opportunities, navigating the graduate school process, or exploring other roles (besides software engineering) within the tech industry.
                <br>
                <br>
                ICSSC has made a lot of progress this year and I hope to continue working together with the council to strengthen our organization next year. My experiences as a member of different ICSSC committees and working in different leadership roles in the Council have given me a better understanding of how our individual committees operate and how ICSSC operates as a whole. I’ve enjoyed my time being active with ICSSC over the years and I hope to continue making an impact. Thank you and I hope you will consider me for ICS Student Council President!

              <p class="mb-4">
                As a member of the ICS Student Council since my freshman year, I’ve watched the club organize, grow, and become a team of great friends and very hardworking individuals that have never ceased to inspire me. I have the dedication, communication, organization, experience, and vision that the club needs to go to the next level, which is why I am running for president. I want to help the student council become a respected and valuable organization and resource for UCI students by serving as a liaison between students, staff, and faculty.
                <br>
                <br>
                Recently, I had the opportunity to speak to the people working on redesigning the UCI website about tying the ICSSC in, and I noticed there was room for improvement in our presence with students and staff alike. After confirming this by speaking to some of my friends that are in ICS but aren’t involved in the council, I noticed that in a largely isolated major, we need to be extra diligent to build a strong community around us.
                <br>
                <br>
                I plan to reach out to more students, and push for events about professional and skill development so that students of all backgrounds interested in tech know the club and are excited to attend its events. Whether it involves collaborating with other clubs, hosting more events relevant to a larger umbrella of students, having a mentorship program open to all, or reaching out to more faculty and companies for research and professional development opportunities, I want to work towards building a reliable and trustworthy platform for students in a largely alienating major to find people with common goals and interests so they can grow in their skills, personally, and professionally.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am confident that together, we can watch the club grow in respect, outreach, and accomplishments, so that we become the go-to, staple ICS organization next year. Vote Ritika! :)

                Hello! My name is Justine, I am an incoming 4th year Computer Science major from the Bay Area, and I have been part of ICS Student Council for the past 2 years. I started as a Public Relations committee member during my 2nd year, and spent my 3rd year as Public Relations chair. I am running for ICS Student Council IVP because I am super dedicated and passionate about ICS Student Council! I truly love this organization, want to help maintain it, and be active in it during my last year in college! I have met some awesome friends through ICS Student Council and have loved being Public Relations chair this past year. This is a community of friends that I love to be around, and I want to help foster this environment for the future years to come! I have seen the growth ICSSC has made in just this past year in comparison to last year, and I want to help continue that positive pattern!
                <br>
                <br>
                The main reason I feel like I am qualified to take on the IVP position is because I have been very active this past year as PR Chair and experienced what it is like to be on board. Similar to the responsibilities of IVP, I have a lot of experience communicating and working with the different committees in ICS Student Council. For example, as PR Chair, I work closely with the graphics and events committee, with my main work on publicizing events. I am a very organized and efficient worker. Since I have experience on board, I know the roles of each committee in ICS Student Council very well and have seen what has worked great and what could be improved for next school year! I have experience in leading my own committee in ICS Student Council, being a mentor for other CS students, and in a professional environment as a Software Engineer Intern! I stand with and believe I can push forward ICSSC's mission to help improve the lives of ICS students socially, academically, and professionally!

                Joining ICSSC back in my Sophomore year at UCI proved to be one of the best choices I could have made in regard to my ICS experience. Prior to joining, I struggled to make meaningful connections with my ICS peers, which in the end put me at a disadvantage in my courses. Finding a club that emphasized the importance of bonding with other ICS majors was what helped me to establish myself in this field. The people I met through events and the resources I was able to access because of ICSSC helped shape the beginning of my career, and I want nothing more than to continue that experience for the incoming and rising ICS community.
                <br>
                <br>
                After running the Events committee for the (cut short) 2019-2020 academic year, I feel as though I have been able to get a better understanding of the ICS community as a whole. Using the experiences I had as Events Chair, I'd like to help represent ICSSC as it's External Vice President, working to provide the ICS community with what it needs in order to flourish as a collective. Although we will not be able to execute ICS Day this year, I will put my best effort into focusing our sights on next year's event to make it as memorable & impactful as can be.
